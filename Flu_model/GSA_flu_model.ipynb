    "# Using GSA to enhance model-informed decisions\n",
    "Mathematical models are often used to inform decision-makers dealing with complex management problems. The model is used to predict the consequences of alternative intervention options, hence providing a quantitative assessment of their benefits and costs. In this context, Global Sensitivity Analysis (GSA) can be used to investigate the space of possible options in a more comprehensive and structured way, including a range of options possibly larger than the few ones that decision-makers would test in a traditional 'what-if?' analysis, and also helping to quantify the importance of intervention options relative to other factors that influence the system response but that are not controllable and potentially highly uncertain.\n",

    "# A flu model example\n",
    "In this Notebook we will use a flu model, which provides a simple mathematical description of the spread of a flu in a city. The model divides the city population into three \"compartments\":\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Vulnerable**: individuals who are vulnerable but not yet infected with the flu;\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Sick**: individuals who are infected with the flu;\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Immune**: individuals have immunity to the flu. This includes individuals who either have recovered from the flu or have been vaccinated.\n",
    "The model describes the change in the number of individuals in each compartment over time, using five parameters: \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Initial number of vaccinated individuals**: people who are immune at the start of the flu season because they were previously vaccinated.\n",
    "- **Contact rate per day**: number of times that an infected individual comes into contact with a vulnerable individual in a day\n",
    "- **Contagion ratio**: proportion of contacts that result in infection\n",
    "- **Recovery time**: the average number of days to get fully recovered\n",
    "- **Vaccination rate**: number of inviduals who are vaccinated per day during the outbreak\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's imagine the following problem. In a city with a population of 100,000 people, we would like to simulate and compare five possible actions:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Increase the number of vaccinated individuals at the start of the flu season. Vaccination costs £70 per person.\n",
    "- Implementing social distancing and isolation measures to reduce the daily contact rate. It is estimated that a reduction of 0.1 points of this rate costs £200,000.\n",
    "- Distribute face masks to reducr the contagion rate. It is estimated that reducing this rate by 0.1 points costs £50,000.\n",
    "- Research and use more efficient treatments to reduce the recovery time. It is estimated that a reduction of 1 day in recovery time costs £100,000.\n",
    "- Increase of the number of daily vaccinations during the outbreak, again at £70 per person.\n",
    "\n",
    "The objective is to keep the sick population below **40%** (40,000 people) at any time, because above this number the healthcare system is overwhelmed. The total available budget to achieve this goal is of **£3,000,000**."
