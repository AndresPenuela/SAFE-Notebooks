An asterisk will appear in the brackets at the top left of the box while the code is being exectued (this may take few seconds) and turns into a number when the execution is over.

    "#What are the key controls of a system?\n",
    "Mathematical models can be used to test hypotheses and increase our understanding of the functioning of the system they represent. For example, models can be used to explore under which conditions a system will reach a particular state, or to anticipate the effects of human interventions on the system. For example, a mathematical model of an ecological system represents the interactions between different species within a certain habitat. The model could be used to explore the conditions under which all the spieces can coexist, or the conditions that would lead to extinction of some; or it could be used to assess the effects of introducing a new species into the habitat, or the effects of removing a certain number of individuals of a spieces - for example through hunting or fishing. \n",
    "In this Notebook we show how Global Sensitivity Analysis (GSA) can help in this context, in particular to identify the key controls of the system response. The underlying assumption here is obviously that the model is a realistic representation of the system, so that what is learnt about the model behaviour applies to the system behaviour too. \n",
    "\n",
    "## An ecological model example\n",
    "In this Notebook we will apply GSA to determine the key controls of a ecological system. For the sake of illustration, we will use a very simple model representing a predator-prey dynamics. The model encompasses two species. One species, the prey, is the primary source of food source for the other, the predator. The predator-prey food chain persists over time thanks to a **negative feedback loop** *(Ref. 1)*. When predators eat preys, the prey population drops; this reduces the predators' food source and soon leads to the predator population to also decline. When predators decline, the predation rate reduces; this reduces pressure on the preys and soon lead to the prey population to increase again. This cycle creates a fluctuating pattern in the prey and predator population densities which is the long-term (oscillating) equilibrium of the system.\n",

    "The predator-prey model we use here *(Ref. 2)* is characterised by five parameters:\n",
    "\n",
    "- *Predator initial population*: the initial number of predator individuals\n",
    "- *Predator attack rate*: the number of times (per week) that a predator attack is successful, i.e. results in killing and eating a prey\n",
    "- *Predator efficiency*: the efficiency at turning food into offspring, expressed as the proportion of successful attacks that lead to creating a new predator \n",
    "- *Predator death rate*: the fraction of the predator population that dies per week\n",
    "- *Prey initial population*: initial number of prey individuals\n",
    "\n",
    "We define as the **optimal habitat equilibrium** of the habitat a situation where both the predator and the prey populations oscillates within the range of **7000 ± 250 individuals each**.\n",
    "\n",
        "## Reaching the optimal habitat equilibrium\n",
        "Now imagine we want to determine a combination of the above 5 parameters that would lead the system to reach the optimal habitat equilibrium within a year. This could be useful for example to inform a sustainable hunting policy. Can you find a combination that put both lines (the predator and prey populations) between the blue dashed lines (7000 ± 250 individuals) before the end of the simulation period?"

This is the defined as the absolute difference of the predator population from 7000 individuals at the end of the simulation, plus the same absolute difference for the prey population. We would like the error to be as close to zero as possible. However, finding a set of parameters that achieve this by varying each of them one-at-a-time is difficult.\n",
