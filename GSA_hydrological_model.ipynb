    "# What are the most important parameters in a mathematical model?\n",
    "Mathematical models often encompass a large number of parameters. The value of these parameters for a particular application are decided by the modeller based on information about the quantities that the parameters represent (for example, measurements from field work or lab experiments). Alternatively, if the modeller possesses some measurements of the system inputs and outputs, then the parameter values can be inferred by finding the values that makes the model best fit those measurements (this is called model 'calibration'). In both cases, determining the 'right' parameter values is often difficult and time consuming, as it may require acquiring and handling a lot of data and/or using of a lot of computing power (if the model is calibrated using a computer algorithm). And yet, parameter estimates may still be uncertain if the available data are sparse or affected by large measurement errors. In this Notebook we see how Global Sensitivity Analysis (GSA) can help in this context.\n",
    "\n",
    "Specifically, we will show how GSA can determine if any of the model parameters have negligible influence on the output we are interested in predicting (or for which we have measurements). If this is the case, then we do not need to invest too much efforts in the estimation of these uninfluential parameters, and we can focus instead on the smaller set of influential parameters, thus saving time while achieving better results. Indeed applications of GSA have shown that the set of parameters controlling a particular output variable is often quite small, although different sets of parameters may control different outputs. Also, if GSA shows that some parameters are uninfluential for all model outputs, then this may mean that the model is unnecessarily complex and give the modeller indications on how to simplify it.\n",

    "## A hydrological example\n",
    "In this Notebook we will apply GSA to determine the influential and uninfluential parameters of a hydrological model. For the sake of illustration, we will use a very simple model with only five parameters. But what is a hydrological model in the first place? Imagine that we want to predict the water flows that drain into a river from the amount of rainfall that has fallen in the river catchment area. For this purpose, we can use a hydrological model, which describes the hydrological processes occuring in the catchment (such as evaporation, surface and underground flows, etc.) via a set of equations. These equations encompass various parameters, describing the properties of the catchment, such as the vegetation and soil characteristics. \n",

    "- Infiltration rate: proportion of effective rain that actually infiltrates into the soil\n",

    "Now imagine we have a time series of measurements of daily rainfall and river flow for a particular catchment. We can use these data to calibrate our model, that is, to find the parameter values that make the model best fit the data. The simplest way to do this is by changing the parameter values one-at-a-time and looking at how this changes the model predictions. Can we fit the predicted river flows to the measured ones?"

    "The search of a good parameters combination would be easier if we could focus on fewer of them, the ones that mostly influence the model predictions. To identify such parameters, we can apply Global Sensitivity Analysis (GSA). Here we use one particular GSA method, PAWN *(Ref. 2)*. It provides a sensitivity index for each model parameter. The index measures the relative influence of that parameter on the calibration error: the lower the index, the smaller the influence. The method also provides a threshold value to identify uninfluential parameters: if the index of a parameter is below the threshold, then the parameter can be considered uninfluential. Now run the cell below to obtain the sensivity indices and the influence threshold (black dotted line).\n",
